# Predicting Customer Churn Using Classification Analysis-
The primary objective of this project is to construct a robust predictive model for determining whether a customer is likely to churn, or in other words, discontinue their services or subscription with a company. To accomplish this objective, the project employs a classification analysis approach, employing a variety of machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Gradient Boosting, and AdaBoost.

The project initiated by assembling an extensive dataset containing a spectrum of customer-related attributes. These attributes encompassed variables such as subscription duration, usage patterns, customer satisfaction scores, and interactions with the customer support team. The dataset underwent rigorous preprocessing, including handling missing data, identifying and addressing outliers, and encoding categorical variables into numerical features.

Using this meticulously prepared dataset, the project implemented each of the machine learning algorithms mentioned above, subsequently evaluating their performance using an array of evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall. The model that exhibited the highest performance across these metrics was designated as the final output of the project.

The selected model not only accurately predicts customer churn but also furnishes valuable insights into the determinants of churn. It aids in the identification of key features that significantly impact customer retention. The project's measure of success resides in its capacity to construct a precise predictive model, thereby empowering business decision-makers to make informed choices regarding customer retention strategies.

In summary, this project underscores the potency of classification analysis in discerning the factors that contribute to customer churn. The insights gleaned from this analysis can be invaluable for companies seeking to retain their customers and enhance their overall customer satisfaction.
